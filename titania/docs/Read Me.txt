Some basic information/things to keep in mind about Titania:

After each new release of phpBB you need to perform a few actions:
	1. Upload the properly named package (ex: phpBB-3.0.7-PL1.zip for 3.0.7-pl1) to store/phpbb_packages
	2. Update the phpbb_versions information in the config.php file to contain the latest version for the updated phpBB branch

For the Styles Demo board:
	If not installing on the main board, it must be on the same server, on a different database, and with the same database prefix
		as the main board uses (limitation of current code using table constants).
